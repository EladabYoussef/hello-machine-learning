# first machine learning project:
## in this project i applied the things i just learned to take a good grasp on machine learning concepts, i learned:
- **linear regression with multiple variables.**
- **implementing gradient descent.**
- **using numpy library and manipulating vectors and matrices.**
- **normalizing the data and dealing with it.**
- **plotting the data with matplotlib.pyplot**
# Housing Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project implements a linear regression model from scratch to predict housing prices based on several features such as size, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and age of the home.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a simple linear regression model to predict housing prices. The model is trained using gradient descent, and the dataset is normalized before training. Various visualizations are also included to help understand the relationship between features and the target variable.

## Features

- **Size:** The square footage of the house.
- **Number of Bedrooms:** The number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Number of Floors:** The number of floors in the house.
- **Age of Home:** The age of the house in years.

## Project Structure

- `housing_price_prediction.py`: The main Python script containing the implementation of the linear regression model.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and how to use it.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
- copy

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
